# gg-plugin

Plugin for GG Code Challenge

This plugin creates a simple shortcode that will display a wistia video, lock it down after 60 seconds and require the user to log in.

The login happens via ajax, and upon success allows the user to continue watching the video.

The shortcode is [mdgg-video] and can be placed on any page once the plugin is active.

In a future iteration this could be connected to a custom post type or the JS could be divorced from the shortcode to dynamically require this on any page with a wistia video.

Total clocked time at this point is 7h58m - yikes!
